# Why is Breast Cancer Awareness so Important?

Every October, you likely see a wealth of information about breast cancer. And that is a good thing. Awareness surrounding breast cancer is incredibly important as early detection, often through screening, can catch the disease when it is most treatable.

According to the **American Cancer Society (ACS)**, breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, except for skin cancers. The average risk of a woman in the U.S. developing breast cancer sometime in her life is about **12% (1 in 8 women)**. The chance that a woman will die from breast cancer is about **2.6% (1 in 38 women).**

## Signs and Symptoms of Breast Cancer

It is essential for every woman to be familiar with how her breasts normally look and feel. **Early detection saves lives.** Signs of breast cancer may include:

- **Lump in the breast** or underarm (armpit)
- **Swelling or thickening** of all or part of the breast
- **Dimpling or skin irritation**
- **Persistent breast pain**
- **Redness, scaliness, or thickening** of the nipple or breast skin
- **Nipple discharge** (other than breast milk)
- **Change in breast size or shape**

Regular **mammograms and clinical breast exams** can detect breast cancer before symptoms even appear.

## Breast Cancer Risk Factors

The main risk factors for breast cancer include:

### **Uncontrollable Factors**
- **Being a woman** (most cases occur in women)
- **Aging** (risk increases after age 55)
- **Family history** of breast or ovarian cancer
- **Genetic mutations** (e.g., **BRCA1, BRCA2**)
- **Breast density** (denser breasts may have a higher risk)

### **Lifestyle-Related Factors**
- **Use of birth control pills or hormone therapy**
- **Having children later in life or not having children**
- **Drinking alcohol** (higher consumption increases risk)
- **Being overweight or obese**
- **Lack of physical activity**

> Having **one or more risk factors does not mean you will get breast cancer.** However, understanding them can help you make **healthy lifestyle choices**.

## How to Lower Your Risk

- ✅ **Maintain a healthy weight**
- ✅ **Exercise regularly** (at least 150 minutes per week)
- ✅ **Limit alcohol intake** (no more than one drink per day)
- ✅ **Consider breastfeeding** (if possible)
- ✅ **Get regular screenings** based on your risk level

## Breast Cancer Screening

Fox Chase Cancer Center follows **breast cancer screening guidelines** from the **American College of Radiology (ACR)** and **Society of Breast Imaging (SBI)**:

✔ **Risk assessment at age 30** to determine early screening needs  
✔ **Screening at age 40** for women at average risk  
✔ **MRI screenings** for high-risk women or those diagnosed before age 50  

### **Types of Breast Cancer Screening**
1️⃣ **Mammogram** – X-ray imaging to detect tumors.  
2️⃣ **Breast Ultrasound** – Used for dense breasts or high-risk patients.  
3️⃣ **Breast MRI** – Recommended for women with a high genetic risk.
