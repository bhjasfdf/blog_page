The beach was the one thing I was holding onto. I had envisioned the sand between my toes, the sound of my boys laughing as they buried each other, the salt air cleansing this nightmare off my skin.

But instead, I was in a hospital bed, neutropenic, isolated, and watching photos of my family’s vacation from my phone. Cancer had taken yet another thing from me. I cried. I raged. And then, I made a decision — I had to focus on the long game. I had to take care of my mind if I wanted to take care of my body.

## The Emotional Toll of Cancer

A breast cancer diagnosis at the age of 40 upended everything. Now there were so many unknowns and scans, plus loss after loss — from fertility to freedom to travel. I had always been a type A perfectionist, managing ADHD and anxiety by staying in control. Cancer forced me to surrender. The grind that once defined me — talk fast, walk fast, work fast — had to stop. My new focus became enduring treatment, slowing down, and healing.

Despite the revolving door of medical appointments, mental health was rarely addressed. Beyond a brief questionnaire about my mood, few asked how I was coping. I was often the youngest person in the chemo room, which left me feeling resentful — and then guilty for feeling that way. I’d remind myself that I was lucky to have access to care, but gratitude and grief often came in waves. I was grateful for science yet resentful to be among the minority of women diagnosed under 62. I was grateful for my support system yet hated needing to rely on them.

## The Breaking Point

One of my darkest moments came after my first round of the “red devil.” I spiked a fever and was admitted to the hospital with severe neutropenia — my immune system at zero. The next day, we were supposed to leave for our annual beach trip. It was the one thing I had looked forward to, the only moment of escape. My husband and I made the painful decision: they would go without me.

Lying in a hospital bed, I moped and cried, watching *White Lotus* while eating inedible hospital food. My husband sent me pictures of our boys splashing in the ocean, and my emotions spiraled between devastation and joy. I was furious at cancer, heartbroken to miss another milestone, and yet relieved that my boys still had their fun. Eventually, I accepted that missing this one trip meant I could be there for many more. Short-term pain for long-term gain.

## Where Are the Recommendations for Mental Health?

While there are endless recommendations for physical health during treatment — strength training, cutting back sugar and alcohol, staying active — mental health is often an afterthought. But anxiety, fear, and grief can be just as debilitating as the physical toll. I had to completely rewire myself to manage stress, calm my nervous system, and reclaim some sense of control.

I also had to consider the mental health of those around me — my partner, my kids, my caregivers. We were upfront with my sons’ teachers, ensuring school counseling was available. Neighbors and friends stepped in when I was too exhausted to function. Accepting help became essential.

## How I Took Control of My Mental Health

### Say Yes! Accept Help & Simplify.
- Friends set up a meal train — I said yes.
- Neighbors took out the trash — I said yes.
- Meal delivery on bad days, meal kits on good ones — I said yes.
- **Lesson learned:** Accepting help is not weakness. It’s survival.

### Define What Community Means to You.
- I designated a “work captain” to share updates so I wasn’t bombarded with messages.
- I leaned into support from LBBC's Young Advocate group — it changed my life.
- **My advice:** Find the level of community that works for you.

### Assemble Your Holistic Care Team.
- **Therapy:** Finding the right therapist — someone who understood trauma — was key.
- **Medication:** Adjusted anxiety meds to manage chemically induced menopausal side effects.
- **Physical therapy:** Learned lymphatic massage to prevent lymphedema and manage scar tissue.
- **Specialist care:** Found a new OB-GYN and PCP for long-term endocrine therapy concerns.
- **Lesson learned:** Cancer care is more than oncology — it requires a whole-person approach.

### Find a Breastie!
- I met one of my closest friends in chemo — same diagnosis, same oncologist, both moms of two boys.
- Meeting my Young Advocate group through LBBC gave me the greatest joy and laughter I had not felt since pre-cancer.
- **Having someone who just gets it is invaluable.**

### Use Local and National Mental Health Resources.
- **Cancer Bridges** provided free yoga, reiki, art therapy, and counseling for my family.
- I started journaling and sharing updates on *CaringBridge*.
- Writing workshops through *Wildfire Magazine* helped me process obsessive thoughts.
- **Lesson learned:** Mental health resources exist — use them.

### Get Grounded and Find Joy.
- The integrative oncology center at my hospital connected me with acupuncture and nutrition counseling.
- I rediscovered yoga, which became my mental and physical sanctuary.
- My yoga therapist introduced me to mindfulness, meditation, and mantras.
- Every morning, I breathe and repeat: *“Healthy cells remain.”*
- **Lesson learned:** Joy is a practice. Find yours.

## My Best Advice to You
- **Find your what and why.** What makes you feel supported? What brings you peace? What can you let go of?
- **Prioritize your mental health as much as your physical health.** It’s not optional — it’s survival.
- **Seek out free resources.** Your cancer center, local organizations, and online communities can help.
- **Accept the journey.** It’s messy, it’s painful, but you are not alone.

I could write an entire book on mental health in survivorship — that’s a whole other chapter. For now, I leave you with this:

**Healthy cells remain. Healthy cells remain. Healthy cells remain.**
