## **Celebrating Women Pioneers in Breast Cancer Research**

Since the **Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF)** was founded three decades ago, there has been a **44% decline in breast cancer deaths**, and today, more than **four million survivors** are living in the U.S. This progress is driven by groundbreaking research and the scientists who dedicate their careers to understanding, treating, and ultimately ending breast cancer.

🌍 While women make up less than **30% of the world’s researchers**, BCRF is proud to support **54% female researchers**—pioneers in the field who are improving outcomes, breaking barriers, and saving lives.

In honor of **Women’s History Month**, we highlight **18 trailblazing women** whose contributions have profoundly shaped breast cancer research.
